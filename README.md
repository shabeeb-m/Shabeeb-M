## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shabeeb Mon M

I am a Data Science Engineer with expertise in analyzing and processing large-scale datasets, creating interactive dashboards, and building automated workflows to support business decision-making. Over the past year, I have worked extensively with Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to deliver actionable insights, improve reporting efficiency, and ensure data accuracy.

I am passionate about transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that drive business outcomes. I enjoy creating visualizations that tell clear stories, building automated processes that improve efficiency, and collaborating with stakeholders to ensure data delivers value. Whether itâ€™s supporting energy-sector projects, optimizing workflows, or enhancing client-facing analytics, I thrive on solving problems and making an impact through data.

In my current role, I monitor project databases to ensure data integrity and workflow efficiency, create detailed analytical visualizations in R, and design Power BI dashboards for client reporting. I also lead commercial streams, coordinating with clients and internal teams to streamline operations and ensure timely project delivery.

My key strengths include developing automated workflows, delivering interactive dashboards, and translating complex data into actionable business insights. I am committed to continuous learning and expanding my expertise in data analytics and visualization, with the goal of creating impactful solutions that empower organizations to achieve better performance and growth.
